== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How long before I start seeing my sales forecast? = 
Immediately, our dashboard provides real-time analytics. 

= Is there a live, free demo available? =
You can start with a free 3-month trial and see if you like what we have to offer.

= How Do You Calculate My Store's Sales Forecast? =
Our forecasting engine analyses your store’s historical and daily sales, in combination with our proprietary machine learning algorithms and external data. This is then translated into a daily sales forecast for all your products.

= Can I get help with setting the parameters for my store? =
Of course - we are friendly people, so don't hesitate to reach out to us and ask for support, or if you have any idea on how we can make our products better.
We also have a dedicated team for support and we'll try our best to answer any questions or solve any problem you encounter.
You can use our dedicated [support portal](https://roadmap.shelfplanner.com/ "support portal")- or simply drop us a line at [support@shelfplanner.com](mailto:support@shelfplanner.com "support@shelfplanner.com").
You will also find lots of tips and guides on our dedicated wiki site: [suppport.shelfplanner.com/en](https://support.shelfplanner.com/en)

= Can I get more frequent updates on my sales forecast than a weekly sales forecast? =
Yes, you can. The Sales Forecast is calculated with live data, but we update the sales forecast for your store only once per week, every Monday morning.
However, if you want to update the forecast on demand, you can do this in the 'Integrations' and 'Update Forecast Data'.

= I have installed the plugin and created an account, but my data is not syncing =
When your data is not synchronising, most likely your server settings are blocking the api from making the calls. Check with your system administrator to set up your store to allow for API calls.
